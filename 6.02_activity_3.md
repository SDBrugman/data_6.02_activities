# 6.02 Activity 3

Use the file `sample_superstore.xls` in the folder `files_for_activities`. Conduct `top N` analysis as we just did on the class with the column `product name` by total sales for that product.ie to find the top N products based on the sales value for that product.

- Please remember to use an inner join between `Order` table and `Return` table. Also you do not need to add a filter on `Order Date` in this case

# 6.02 Activity 2

In this activity you can continue using the previous Tableau workbook.
If you are using a new workbook, use the file `sample_superstore.xls`. Create a join between `orders` and `returns` so that we have the data for the orders that were not returned (For this you will have to use a left join with `Orders` table on the left and then put a filter to select null values from `Returns` table), and add a filter for orders made in 2017. Now follow the steps below:

- Create a parameter called `Parameter_quantity`. It should be of type integer and should take a range of values, with minimum value of 1, maximum value of 20, and a step size of 1. (You can also use the option `Set From Field` to choose the maximum value in the range. It should be 14 in this case)
- Create a calculated field `calculated_quantity` as

  ```sql
  IF [Quantity] = [Parameter_quantity] THEN "Yes"
  ELSE "No"
  END
  ```

- Create a plot between `Customer Name` and `Discount` (with average as aggregation). (Add all members from `Customer Name`)
- Add the parameter to the sheet. 
- Now add the calculated field `calculated_quantity` to Filter Pane. Add the filter for only `Yes` values
- Vary the parameter and observe how the plot changes.
  Note: This can used to analyze how the discounts are provided to different customers based on the quantity ordered.
